- **MathNet.Numerics**: A library for numeric computations (included but not used in this particular script).

## Features
- Open and manage multiple browser windows.
- Navigate and switch between multiple **frames** within a webpage.
- Interact with various web elements like textboxes, buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns.
